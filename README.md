#Mission Coordination Project <br />
<br />
The purpose of this project is to control the movement of three simulated robots using ROS and Gazebo, so that each robot reaches its designated flag as quickly as possible. The robots have the capability to track their position and orientation within the simulation.
In this project we want to move the robot to the appropriate flag, using diffrent approaches. <br />
Files which contains our implementation are: <br />
 •	**agent.py** - Timing solution applied <br />
 •	**agent_PID** - Solution of controlling the velocity <br />
 •	**agent_robust** - Robot-to-Flag navigation <br />
